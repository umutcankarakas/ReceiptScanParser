# Receipt Scan Parser
This project is a simple parser for a json data which is extracted from a receipt.

We can break the project into three parts: 

1- Reading the json and creating a list of objects out of it.

2- Creating a list of strings, which has all the substrings of a line merged together according to their coordinates

3- Writing the result into a text file

You can just open the solution and run it, the input and the output will be in the bin file.

Essential parts of the code have explanatory comments, but you are welcome to contact me if you have any further questions.
